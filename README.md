# Part 1
Project Outline:

1. Introduction- Storyline shown through pcitures of people with sublitites to alcohol with captions to catch the readers attention.

2. Intro to social media and alcohol- Connect social media usage with alchol consumption.

3. Stories- People who have directly been negatively affected from alcohol use.  

4. Data- Both short-term and long-term effects of alcohol usage at a young age.

5. Call To Action- How to spot misuse and abuse, what this looks like with resources. 


Summary- 
My project will address how social media connects to alcohol abuse and misuse among young adults and college students. This will include the long-term and short-term health effects of drinking and how that plays a role into people's lives and what can be done to stop it.

# Part 2
Method and Medium- 
Process:
From the last iteration of this project, I have decided to change my approach because this topic is done frequently, and it could use more attention. Additionally, because this topic is often overdone, I wanted to narrow my topic from overall alcohol abuse for every age level to the relationship between alcohol and social media. Essentially, what I want to show here is how young adults can appear flawless and nonchalant with alcohol in their pictures when there is a deep-seated issue that is ignored. 
My basis for this visualization will be based on research articles from the NIH as a data source and a SELF article that inspired this data visualization and more directed call to action. The focus is on those who have developed an alcohol addiction but their presence on social media does not show the downsides of alcohol but the positive images that can be associated with it.
To guide the story, I will use pictures of people who have alcohol in their photos but the photos could not suggest that the person photograph has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. My call to action will be to challenge people to question those who may fit this profile and how to offer help whether it is resources or tips/strategies.
An empowering statistic to lead the story is that: “One in every 12 adults abuse or depend on alcohol, and it's the third ‘leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the nation’”. I plan to use this statistic to show the gravity of alcohol dependence and its role in our lives as young adults.

Because I chose to switch gears, here is the new storyboard/arc/wireframe that I have come up with:

Wireframes and storyboards can be found on the link [here!](https://julie-reighard.github.io/Part-2/)

User Research: 
I interviewed a few of my younger friends and an older family member to gain feedback on the storyboard. After aggregatting their feedback, I needed to improve the transition from the introduction into the story and from the story to the data to link it to the health effects.

# Part 3
I made a lot of changes to my storyboard from part 2 to part 3. First I changed the pictures/people I presented in the introduction so I could get better quality pictures that portrayed the message a little more subtly. This aspect was challenging because it was difficult to find high quality pictures with subtleties of alcohol. Another change I made was adding in sad and horrible drinking stories to make the tone change from joking to serious. Previously, I only had one story and it seemed out of place in the story. Putting these recaps, titiling it “top college drinking stories” matches how social media gives you “best moments” from the year and I wanted to match the theme with the Instagram worthy pictures. Putting these aspects one after another was meant to lure the audience in by engaging them through the pictures followed by surprising stories and statics, showing them that this could very likely be you. This transition/process was difficult because I was unsure of where to put the “1 out of 5 students leave college with an alcohol abuse disorder.” It was a really shocking statistic that needing to be included but the right place for it was difficult to find. 

I also changed where/what I said about connecting social media to drinking habits. I was trying to display here the dramatic rise in social media usage and how different content receives different “likes” from the audience. Furthermore, I was trying to link these two things to a psychological aspect that college students are young, impressionable and in a transition stage in their lives where are more willing to partake in riskier behaviors in order to fit in and that is where the real problem occurs. People posting pictures to appear one way online to gain popularity, while their life may be completely different on the one side of the screen. This idea here was from the Netflix documentary, “The Social Dilemma” where the speakers determine that social media has an addictive and psychological impact that has began to control our lives without our consent or explicit knowledge. The younger generations yearning for “likes” and friendship is now through screen where they become obsessed with the numbers and superficial matters which is what ultimately alters their decision making. This was really difficult because there was no hard data just stories and qualitive research that I did not have access to. 

Finally, I changed my graph from the health effect to include only the intended audience (ages 18-24) to show both the long and short-term health effects of an alcohol abuse disorder. Again, finding data on this information was difficult because a lot of the long-term effects are not seen until later in life. A change to show here would be to give a startling statistic on number of college students sent to the Emergency Department or on academic probation/disciplinary action due to alcohol abuse. And have this followed by the long-term effects which almost always lead to death.
